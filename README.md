# Activity-On-Edge
This program makes use of a network or weighted directed graph abstract data type to represent the  inter-dependencies among activities in a project. Once the is represented as a graph, it can be analyzed to determine if the project is feasibility, how long the project will take, and what activities are “critical” 
meaning that if they are not completed in time the entire project is delayed
