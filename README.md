# Activity-On-Edge
This program utilizes a network or weighted directed graph abstract data type to represent the interdependencies among activities in a project. Once the project is represented as a graph, it can be analyzed to determine feasibility, project duration, and critical activities. Critical activities refer to those that, if not completed on time, will cause delays in the entire project.
